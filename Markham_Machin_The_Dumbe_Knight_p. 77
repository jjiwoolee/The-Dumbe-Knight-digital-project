The dumbe Knight.
Be founded by the plumes of forrainers ?
Well, the revenge that I will take for this my shame,
Shall make all whores hereafter dread my name.
Cyp. Not for thy life, not for my love I charge thee :
Thy wife is honest chast and vertuous :
Onely this wanton Lord, with lust and coine
Hath much attempted, but prevail’d in nought,
For proofe see here the crownes he would have given
T’have purchas’d her beds honour, but shee would not,
Which I bestow on you for recompence.
Therefore as thou dost hope my grace to finde,
So to thy wife, be loving, gentle, kind.
Prat. Your Maiestie may mold me to your pleasure,
I thanke you and will quittance it.
Cyp. Now Messant, we restore you to your lands,
Your honours and neere places, next our selfe,
To all that feele distaste in any sore,
We give to cure them all our grace and favour.
Thus stormes bring gentle sun-shine, and our hands,
May after ship-wracke bring us to safe lands.
FINIS.
