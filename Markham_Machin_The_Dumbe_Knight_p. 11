Act. 1. Scen. 1. Musicke.
Enter the King of Cypres, Phylocles, Florio, and attendants in
armes.
Cypres.
INough, these loud sounds deafes my passions,
How long shall love make me a slave to hope,
And mixe my calme desires with tyranny ?
O Phyloeles 'tis heresie I hold,
Thought and affection cannot be control'd.
Phy. Yet may 'tbe bent and supple'd with extreames,
Sith fewe dare see the end of violence :
What makes the skilfull Leech to vse the fire,
Or warre her engines,or states policie,
But to recover things most desperate ?
Revolt is recreant,when pursuit is brave,
Never to faint doth purchase what we crave.
Cyp. True my Phyloeles,yet my recreant soule,
Slaved to her beauty,would renounce all warre,
And yeeld her right to love,did not thy spirit
Mixt with my longing,fortifie these armes.
But I am now resolv'd,and this sad houre
Shall give an end to my distemperature.
Summon a parley.
Enter aloft, the Queene of Sicile,the Duke of Epire, Alphonse,
and attendants.
Queene. What saies our tyrant sutor,our disease in love,
That makes our thoughts a slave unto his sword :
What sayes my Lord ?
