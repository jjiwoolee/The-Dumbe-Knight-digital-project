To the Understanding Reader
VMOVR, that hydra headed Monfter, with 
more tongues then eyes by help of his intelli-
gencer Envy hath made strange misconfirm-
ations on this dumbe Knight, which then
could not anfwere for kimfelfe: but now this
publication doth unty his tongue, to answere
the objections of all Iharpe Criticallcensures,
which heretofore have undefervedly paft up-
on him. And for my part (I protest) the wrongs I have received 
by fame (whole worths I will not traduce) with a milde neglect I
have laught at their follies, for I thinke my felfe happy, because I have beene envyed, since the beft now in grace have bin subject to
fome flanderous tongues that want worth themselves, and think it
great praise to them to detract praise from other that deserve it; yet
having a partner in the wrong, whose worth hath bin often approo-
ued, I count the wrong but halfe a wrong, because he knows beft
how to answere for hmselfe: But I now in his absence, make this
Apology, both for him and me. Thus leaving you and the book te-
gether, I ever rest yours.
