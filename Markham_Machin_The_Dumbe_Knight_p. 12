The dumbe Knight.
Cypr. Madame attend me, this is my last summons,
The many sunnes my sorrowes have beheld,
And my sad nights of longings, all through hope,
T’enjoy the joy of earth, (your owne deare selfe)
Are growne infinite in length and waight,
That like to wearied Atlas, I inforce
These warres as Hercules, to beare my loade :
Briefly I must enjoy you, or else loose
The breath of life, which to prevent, behold,
My sword must be my Cupid, and with feathered steele,
Force pitty from your brest, your Cities walles,
Chided with my Canons, have set ope a path
And boldly bids me enter, all your men of warre,
Feebled with Famine, and a weary siege,
Take danger from mine actions, onely your selfe,
Strong in your will, oppose even destinie :
And like the Giants warre offend the heavens.
Which to prevent, doe but descend and give
Peace to my love-suit, and as overcome thereby,
Ile yeeld my selfe your prisoner, and be drawne
A thrall in your triumphant victory.
If otherwise, behold these fatall swords,
Shall never be sheath’d, till we be conquerours :
And not respecting innocence nor sexe,
The cryes of infants, nor the prayers of age.
All things shall perish, till within my armes
I fold your selfe my thrall and conquerour.
Lu. Thou maist be master of my bodies Tombe,
But for my soule and mind, they are as free
As their creation : and with Angels wings
Can soare beyond thy reach; trust mee King of Cypres,
Those coales the Roman Piramis did devoure,
Are not burnt out, nor have th’Egyptian wormes
Yet lost their stings, steele holds his temper still,
And these are rancimes from captivitie.
But art thou Noble, hast thou not Royall thought ?
Cypr.
