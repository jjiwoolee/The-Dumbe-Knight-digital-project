The dumbe Knight.
Cyp. We will see the businesse perfited.
Dra. Ve. With all our hearts, and be full joy’d thereat, here
are the crownes.
Cyp. You shall have your dispatches.
Enter Prate and Florio.
See here comes the Orator, Prate come hither,
These Gentlemen whom long since I prefer’d
To your dispatches, are yet unsatisfied.
Prate. Alas my Lord the state.
Cyp. I know imploies you, yet theres many minutes,
May give your best cares leasure; come there is
Some odd disburse, some bribe, some gratulance,
Which makes you locke up leasure, come tell true,
What bribe must they give, what is your utmost price?
Prate. But five hundred crownes of my best conscience.
Cyp. Tut it is nothing, hold, heres the coine,
And let them have their pattents presently.
Or looke to lose both place and soveraigntie.
Prat. Legions of divells haunt their diligence.
Cyp. Fie, I would not have a man of your high place,
Or for respect of wealth or base observance,
In smallest things thus to neglect your credit. (ranke,
Why looke you my Lords, this Orator is not like others of his
Who from their gainish and fantastic humours,
Goe thorow the streets, spotted in peacocks plumes,
Wearing all colours, laces, broideries,
Sattins and silkes, so antike garnished,
That when their gownes are off, you cannot finde
In Italic a Master that more nice.
But this fellow Prate, heres of another sort,
Cloth’d like himselfe, demure and soberly,
Nay you shall see him for a president. Vngownes the Orator.
Passion of mine eie-sight, who have we here?
This is Alphonso, theres the Orator.
Pra. Heart of impatience, I am then a Cuckold,
A scorne, a by-word and a laughing stocke.
What is my wife turn’d whore? and must her depth
