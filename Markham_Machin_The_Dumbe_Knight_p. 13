The dumbe Knight
Cyp. Approve me by your question.
Queene. Then briefly thus :
To shunne the great effusion of their bloods,
Who feele no touch in mine affections,
Dare you to single combate, two to two,
Reserue your right in love?
Cyp. Who are your combatants? we love equality.
Queene. This is the first, the Epire Duke, a man,
Sprung from the line of famous Swauderbag :
The next Alphonso, sprung from noble blood :
Who laden with rich Lusitanian prize,
Hath rode through Syracus twice in pompe.
Cyp. Their likings to the motion
Epi. They are like wrath,
Never unarm’d to beate weake injury.
Alph. Nay more, we are the sonnes of destiny :
Vertu’s our guide, our ayme is dignity.
Phy. S’foot King, shall not forsake them : this I see,
Love, fight, and death, are rul’d by destiny.
Cyp. My spirit speaketh thy motion,
Madame, although advantage might evade,
And give my love more hope, yet my bent will,
Bowd to your pleasure, doth embrace your law,
We doe accept the combate, and our selfe
Will with that Duke try fortunes, this my friend,
The more part of my selfe, my deereft Phyloeles,
One of an Angels temper, shall with that Lord
Trie best and worst, the place, the time, the sword.
Epi. They are your rights, we claime as challengers.
Cyp. And we would lose that vantage, but since fame
Makes vertue equall, we embrace our rights :
The place before these walles, the houre next sunne,
The Pollax and the hand axe for the fight.
Queene. It is enough.
My hostage is my person and my love.
Cyp. And mine my hope, my faith and royaltie.
They
