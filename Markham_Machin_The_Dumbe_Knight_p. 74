The dumbe Knight.
So helpe you love.
Phi. They are.
Cyp. Then give the warlike signall to the fight.
Here the combat being fought, Phyloeles overcomes the Duke.
Phi. Thou art my slave, either confesse or die.
Epi. Didst thou speake true, I would not found a word
To save the world from cinders; yet that thou maiest
With more resolved fury murder me,
This I confesse, ’twas I that onely stir’d,
Out of strong falsehoods hate and jealousie
The Kings eternall wrath, and made him thinke
Untruths, that even untruth would not suggest :
And all my malice sprung from that Prince Phyloeles.
Phi. No ’twas from me that still am Phyloeles.
Cyp. My Phyloeles, my Queen, O double pardon me,
My jealousie, his envy, and your vertues
Are sprung from such impatient contraries,
I cannot reconcile them; yet O pardon me :
My faith in life shall make you recompence :
For thee rare Mariancha, thou hast wrought
A worke of noble constant magnitude.
As for this monster, this my tempting divell,
Whose forfeit life is witnesse to his shame :
I give his life and fortunes to the Queene,
She whom his malice would have brought to death,
Shall now be judge and juror of his breath.
Ma. In which commission, (Madam) let he inrold
He is my brother and my best of blood.
Qu. And onely that is charter for his life :
Live envious Lord, more envious then th’art great,
Live to lament thy worst of wretchednesse,
Live to repent, since this I certaine know :
Thine owne gald conscience will be thy worst woe.
Enter a guard of Watchmen with Alphonso.
Watch. Come bring him away, thrust him forward, though
