favour and a great purle were against him.
Cyp. How now, what tumult have we there?
2.Watch. And it please your Maiesty, we have brought you here
a slip, a piece of false coine: one that is neither stampt with true coin
for his excuse, nor with good clothes for his redemption.
Cyp. Alphonso, in the name of madnes how comes this Metamor-
phosis, nay stand forth, discourse, if thou dost lie thou art mine enemy.
Me. Nay more, if thou sticke in any bogge, and by a tricke seek
to wind out, I will discover you.
Alp. This coniuration (beleeve it my Lord) shall make mee leape
out of all fetters, and briefly thus, I have long time loved the faire
wife of the Orator: and having no opportunity but his absence at
the Senate, I tooke that season: he out of negligence, omitting his
papers, return’d unseasonably, found me insufficiently, and forc’t me
to take sanctuary strangely, which how ever I purchast, yet hee
found me apparel’d, and mistaken in the tenure, reacht it presently,
put it on immediatly: and now in the Senate house is pleading in
it seriously.
Cyp. I cannot blame him you having got so much within his in-
ward garment.
Me. Of all which my Lord, I being (in a strict conceit) a bavv-
dy witnesse: and having both from the Orators scornes and delaies
received many indignities; though by this discovery to cry quit-
tance with my proud enemy.
Cyp. And you have amply done yet this jest,
So perfit doth deserve more memory.
Florio, goe bid the Orator attend us presently. Exit Florio.
And now to you Drap and Velours, I did
Referre you long since to the Orator.
Yet I note your attention: come there is
Some too close fitted hardnesse in your hearts,
You gripe too hard, your bribes will not disburse,
Come tell me truely, as you looke for heaven,
What must you pay for your dispatches?
Dra. Ve. A thousand crownes we offered willingly.
Cyp. And will your suit availe with such disbursement?
Dra. Ve. It will, and we most richly satisfied.
