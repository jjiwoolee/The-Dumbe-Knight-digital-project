The dumbe Knight.
Can rightlie judge my pure complexion :
Yet as your handmaid let me beg the right,
Due unto wretches from our countries lawes.
Cyp. The tenure of the law you doe demand.
Qu. That in the case of slander, where the proofe
Proceeds as much from envie as from truth,
We are allow’d our champions to defend
Our innocence, with a well ordered sword.
Cyp. I lookt for this objection and allow it,
Nor am I unprovided for your best
And strongest hope in any victorie, Lords attend on my champion.
Here the noble men goe foorth, and bring in the Duke of Epyre like a combatant.
Qu. Will you my Lord approve the Kings assertion?
Epy. Madame, although against the nature of my spirit,
And my first dutie, bound to your allegeance,
Yet now compel’d by dutie and by trueth,
I must of force become your opposite.
Qu. Thou art no true Italian, nor true Gentleman,
Thus to confound the glory of thy judgement.
Hath not that arme which now is arm’d against me
That valour, spirit, judgement and that worth,
Which onely makes you worthy, stood t’approve
More then my selfe will challenge to my vertues ?
And are you now falsly turn’d retrograde?
Well, I perceive there’s nought in you but spleene,
And times observance, still to hold the best :
Still I demand the Law.
Cyp. And you shall have it in the amplest manner. Sound Cornets.
Here the Cornets sound thrice, and at the third sound enters Phyloeles disguised like a combatant.
Flo. There is a combatant on the defendants part, your Maiesties pleasure.
Cyp. Give him his oath according to the lawes.
Flo. Are the faire ends of this your warlike posture,
To prove the innocence of these two condemn’d ?
