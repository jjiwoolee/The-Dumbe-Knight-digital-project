For this project, I selected a concise set of metadata fields that balance essential bibliographic description with usability for digital analysis. Each page (file) receives a unique_id and file_name to ensure that the digital images can be clearly identified and cross-referenced within a structured dataset. Page_sequence and page_label preserve the physical and textual order of the book, which is critical for any future digital edition or reconstruction of the printed work. The core bibliographic fields- title, authors, date, and place- record the book’s identity and production context, grounding the dataset in its early modern publishing history. I included shelfmark and source_library to maintain the provenance of the digitized object and to connect my files to the Kislak Center’s catalog holdings. The colenda_url provides a stable digital link to the online facsimile, ensuring that the dataset can be verified and extended in the future. Finally, language and subjects capture the intellectual and thematic dimensions of The Dumbe Knight, enabling researchers to situate the work within early modern English drama and related studies. I was planning on including scenes and acts as additional metadata yet some pages did not include them, so I ultimately decided to exclude them. I chose to limit the metadata to these descriptive and structural categories to create a manageable, consistent dataset that supports both humanistic interpretation and future digital workflows.
